Create a customizable AWSD movement system for any(?) ARPG games using AutoHotkey.

# How to use

1. Download and install AutoHotkey from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

2. Download the `.ahk` file from this repository.

3. Start your ARPG game.

4. Use Notepad/SublimeText/VSCode or whatever text editor you prefer to open the `.ahk` file.

5. Read the comments in the file and customize the parameters.

6. Run the `.ahk` file by double clicking on it.

7. Probably some parameters will still need to be adjusted. Edit the file again and reload it. Again, read the comments in the file. Trial and error is the way to go.

8. If you are happy with the settings, save the file to a cloud service like Google Drive or Dropbox. So you don't need to do all the above again.
